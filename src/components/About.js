      <h2>About ArteLepre</h2>
      <p className="about-description">
        Established in 1959, the Lepre business is a family-run artisan
        restoration workshop. We have over 60 years of experience in the field
        of cabinet making and restoration of antique furniture, with particular
        interest in Italian, French and English styles. Since his young age,
        Lepre Raffaele has acquired the knowledge of this art thanks to the
        teachings of his uncle, cabinetmaker Sassano Giacomo, gaining experience
        and professionalism.

      <p className="about-description">
        I'm an Italian guy, specifically from Naples. I come from a family of
        restorers and antique dealers. I have more than 20 years of experience
        in this field. I moved to Washington DC for love and passion. I'm
        currently working at a well-known antiquarian in Georgetown and would
        like to expand my business. Try me !! The company guarantees its
        customers the quality of its meticulous restoration by hand using
        exclusively traditional methods, such as spirit polishing and shellac,
        beeswax polishing, and integration of missing parts through the use of
        antique wood in order to return the original state to the restored
        pieces.
